            Hi there! My name is Neil. I am a self taught programmer, web
            developer and games developer with a true passion for coding. I
            first got into coding around 24 months ago when i was looking
            around trying to turn my childhood passion, Video Games, into an
            income stream. Since then i have explored many aspects to do with
            video games development and found that my true passion lies in
            coding. I have taught myself all the fundamentals of Full Stack Web Development using the MERN stack
            as well as Unity, Aodbe Suite, Video Editing, Sound Engineering
            and other things necessary to make games. With all that said, i am
            an avid student of the coding arts who is looking to bring his
            life experience to a company in a coding role where i can learn
            from people in the field and broaden my horizons. While i may not
            have a formal education, i bring a wealth of life experience, and
            even more passion, that will be a great asset to any company.

            From the design concept to ease of execution, this experience has
            been Phenomenal. No question was to silly or request to
            outrageous. Neil's professionalism is second to none. I can't
            thank you enough for how you have dealt with every single aspect
            of this design and i honestly could not be happier with the
            outcome. I can't wait to tell everyone i know to check out your
            work. I'm proud to display it and excited to see how it's
            received. Absolute best decision i ahve ever made. Thank you from
            the bottom of my heart. You are a master and have made my own work
            look even better.

            Neil has a great understanding for game development. He was able
            to assist on many aspects of both games we developed. Highly
            valued asset.

            I was lucky enough to work alongside Neil and over conversation he mentioned he could build
            me a website for the start up BootCamp i was talking about and planning on launching. Not
            being very knowledgeable in the field it was something I have been meaning to look into but
            hadn't built up the mental energy or motivation to open that door. Neil not only took on the task
            with fantastic charisma but showed and informed me of what hed done and was about to do
            everystep of the way. It was effortless on my half and i now have what i need without having to
            lift a finger. I like that he has understood what my site is for and the requirements i need it to do
            and given it a great individual personalization with his unique style that aims to take you on a
            little journey thru the site and an all round better browsing experience.
